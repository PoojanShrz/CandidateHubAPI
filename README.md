# CandidateHubAPI

## Improvements

### 1. Error Handling
Implement global error handling using middleware to ensure consistent error responses.

### 2. Validation
Add data validation annotations to the `Candidate` model to ensure proper data is submitted.

### 3. Logging
Implement logging using a logging framework like Serilog or NLog to track application behavior and errors.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization
Add authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the API endpoints.

### 5. Asynchronous Operations
Ensure all database operations are performed asynchronously for better performance.

### 6. Unit Testing
Add unit tests for controllers and services to ensure code reliability and facilitate easier maintenance.

### 7. CORS Policy
Configure CORS policy to restrict access to the API from specific domains.

### 8. Pagination
Implement pagination for `GET` endpoints that return lists of candidates to improve performance and manageability.

### 9. DTOs and AutoMapper
Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and AutoMapper to decouple the domain models from API models.

### 10. Swagger Enhancements
Add more detailed descriptions and examples in the Swagger documentation for better API usability.

## Assumptions

1. The database connection string in `appsettings.json` is correctly configured and points to a valid SQL Server instance.
2. The `Candidate` model provided in the task represents the complete set of fields required.
3. The database schema does not require additional complex relationships (e.g., many-to-many).
4. The API does not need to support localization or multiple languages.
5. The current security requirements do not necessitate encryption or secure storage of sensitive fields beyond the default measures.
6. There is no requirement for performance optimizations beyond the default configurations provided by ASP.NET Core.

## Total Time Spent

The total time spent on this task is approximately **11 hours**, broken down as follows:

- Project setup and configuration: 1 hour
- Implementing CRUD operations in `CandidatesController`: 3 hours
- Database setup and migrations: 4 hour
- Testing and debugging: 2 hour
- Writing documentation and improvement suggestions: 1 hour
